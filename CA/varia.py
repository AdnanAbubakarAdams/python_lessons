# Arithmetic Operators
# +	Addition operator that adds two values together	1 + 1
# -	Subtraction operator that removes the value of the right side from the left side	1 - 2
# /	Division operator that divides the left side as many times as the right side specifies	10 / 2
# *	Multiplication operator	2 * 2

# Assignment Operators
# =	x = 2 x now contains 2.
# +=	x += 2 x incremented by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 4.
# -=	x -= 2 x decremented by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 0.
# /=	x /= 2 x divided by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 1.
# *=	x *= 2 x multiplied by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 4.
