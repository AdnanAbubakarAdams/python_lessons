# Defining List Comprehensions
'''The syntax of list comprehensions is based on the way mathematicians define sets and lists, a syntax that leaves it clear what the contents should be.
For example S is a set of the square of all integer numbers from 0 to 9. In math notation, we write:
S = {xÂ² : x in {0 ... 9}}
Python's list comprehensions give a very natural way to write statements just like these. It may look strange early on, but it becomes a very natural and concise way of creating lists, without having to write for-loops.
Let's see again the comparison with for loops:'''

# This code below will create a list with the squares
# of the numbers from 0 to 9
S = [] # we create an empty list
for i in range(10): # We iterate over all numbers from 0 to 9
    S.append(i*i) # We add in the list the square of the number i
print(S )# we print(the list)

S = [i*i for i in range(10)]
print(S)

# 
V=[] # Create a list
for i in range(13): # Change i to be from 0 to 12
    V.append(2**i) # Add 2**i in the new list
print(V)

# And rewritten as a list comprehension:
V = [2**i for i in range(13)]
print(V)

# from the NBA teams up the file
franchise_names = []
look_for = 'B' #looking
for team in nba_teams:
    franchise = team.split()[-1]
    if franchise.startswith(look_for):
        franchise_names.append(franchise)
print(franchise_names)

# 
look_for = 'B'
franchise_names = [team.split()[-1] for team in nba_teams if team.split()[-1].startswith(look_for)]
print(franchise_names)

# 
# Alternatively, you can even break the lines within a comprehension
# This may help with readability
franchise_names = [team.split()[-1]
                   for team in nba_teams
                   if team.split()[-1].startswith(look_for)]
print(franchise_names)

# 
M = []
for i in S: # iterate through all elements in S
    if i%2 == 0: # if i is an event number
        M.append(i) # ..add it to the list
print(M)

M = [x for x in S if x%2 == 0]
print(M)
